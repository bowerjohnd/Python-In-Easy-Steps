Python in easy steps
2nd Edition, Â© 2022

I found this book easy to follow and time effective.
Most lessons consist of two pages, with a half page
to a full page explanation of the lesson, followed
by a step by step python script. Most notable topics
covered in the book are the basics of syntax and flow, 
cgi/web, GUI basics, and creating standalone .exe
applications. Be aware though, Windows Defender will
most likely flag and quarantine your .exe apps, which
you may be able to restore and have it work, or you
may need to find other solutions on the internet.

The book begins with showing you how to install Python
on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, however, Windows is the
OS the book uses for all the lessons. To keep things
simple, the book also suggests you use notepad for
writing the scripts and command prompt to execute them, 
only showing a screenshot of IDLE IDE once, to show the 
color scheme IDEs provide.

I recommend Python in easy steps to anyone who would
like a quick introduction to Python in short lessons.
Each chapter takes about 1 hour to complete and several
of the topics are carried over into other lessons.
