Random Lotto Number generator program.

Each "lotto" file has a new step in the process of getting
to the final "lucky.py" file.

In the book, Python in easy steps, it has you use pyinstaller.
The first time I followed the book, Windows Defender popped
up as detecting a virus. I went into Windows Defender and
restored the lucky.exe file. Then deleted the "build" and
"dist" directories, as well as any other new files that 
showed up, ran the pyinstaller again, just like the
first time, and everything worked out without an issue.
